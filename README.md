Autohit is an XML-based automated test tool.  This version is stable.

Autohit 1998 is a testing harness that uses XML scripts. This is the predecessor to Autohit 2003 and was never widely released. As such, the documentation was never completed. The software is finished and working, and was used in a couple test systems. It is geared to HTTP/Web testing.

The scripts are compiled into virtual machine code. Each instruction provided fairly high level functionality and when used in HTTP/Web testing it is sufficiently fast. It would make a terrible general purpose VM.
